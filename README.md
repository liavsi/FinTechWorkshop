Stocks Liquidity Analysis with Machine Learning Models
Overview:
This project, developed in collaboration with the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE), aims to address the liquidity challenges faced by the Israeli stock market. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and developing a user-friendly query interface, the project seeks to enhance the transparency and efficiency of stock market transactions.

Key Features:
Machine Learning Algorithm: Predicts optimal buying and selling times for shares based on pre-defined criteria, minimizing the spread between transaction prices and the actual value of shares.
Query Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface for stock exchange employees to filter and analyze transaction data based on various criteria.

Technologies Used:
Python
Machine Learning Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib
Power BI for data visualization and querying
Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration
